# **EASY BUS**

The existing system relies heavily on manual, book-based processes, making it cumbersome for both students and faculty to manage bus-related services. In the wake of the COVID-19 situation, the need for an automated system has become even more apparent. Manual work increases exponentially with the growth of services, requiring a large workforce and meticulous attention to records.

### **Challenges in the Existing System**
- Difficulties in keeping records of items, seat availability, and prices per seat.
- Manual bill generation for each transaction.
- Inefficient search for information, requiring users to sift through numerous records.
- Increased workload for staff and higher chances of human error.

To address these challenges, we introduce the **Bus Renewal System**.
